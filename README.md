# Wissem Ellefi - Data Scientist


## About Wissem :information_desk_person:

Wissem Ellefi is a dedicated data scientist with a strong commitment to leveraging data for informed decision-making. Holding a bachelor's degree in physics and a master's degree in data science, Wissem has gained valuable practical experience throughout his career. In his recent freelance role, he developed an LLM-powered application that assists developers in understanding documentation and writing and executing code using Python and Langchain.

During his tenure at Talan in 2023, Wissem led a data-driven project aimed at enhancing the recruitment process. He created an intelligent job matching and resume ranking system utilizing Machine Learning and NLP, along with an interactive dashboard to aid recruiters in selecting the best candidates. This project involved the use of Python, PowerBI, Talend, and MySQL.

At Amen Bank in 2022, Wissem designed a time-saving software solution to automatically extract and inject information from balance sheets into the database. This innovation significantly improved agent efficiency through the application of computer vision and OCR technologies.
